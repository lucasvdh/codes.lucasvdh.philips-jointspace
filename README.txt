This app adds support for Philips TV's models ranging from ~2014 up to 2019 using the Jointspace protocol.
Older models might need to manually enable this.

## Features and fixes
- On/off detection doesn't crash anymore
- New flow trigger: "An app was opened"
  (e.g. "Netflix" was opened)

## Known issues
There are still some unresolved issues in the pairing process. These are very hard to resolve, if you are experiencing
these issues and want to contribute please contact me.
